I'm Jonathan Tu Nguyen, a machine learning engineer. 

I'm a senior machine learning engineer at [Voodoo](https://www.voodoo.io/), where I build a bidding system that allows app developers to rapidly monetize their apps by leveraging machine learning and predictive algorithms. Previously, I built a system for extracting relevant information from documents and a speech recognition system that automate the manual process which consists of translating audio calls into text and making business insights from that. 
My technical stack includes working with state-of-the-art machine learning models in recommendation systems, bandit, and statistical models (winning rate probability or click-through rate), computer vision, NLP and putting them into deployment at scale with modern tech frameworks to serve our very large base of users. 

In my free time, I travel, read, build side projects and participate Kaggle. 

This is a place where I'm documenting my learning notes, sharing my ideas, thoughts about machine learning/deep learning.  
Drop me an email at jonathan.tunguyen AT gmail.com if you have any questions or just want a discussion. 

Thanks.
